## React + Vite Installation Guide
This guide will walk you through the steps required to set up a React project using Vite. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide super-fast development and build experiences for modern web projects. This template also includes Fast Refresh for efficient Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development, along with some predefined ESLint rules.

# Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 12 or later)
npm (usually comes with Node.js installation)
Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-vite-react-project.git
Replace your-username and your-vite-react-project with the appropriate values.

# Installation
Navigate to the project directory:
cd your-vite-react-project

Install the project dependencies using npm:
npm install

npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server, which provides hot module replacement (HMR) for fast and efficient development. Your application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
